Work Log - TechMart Analytics Dashboard

[10:00 PM]
Starting with project setup. Going with FastAPI for the backend - really like its async capabilities and the documentation is great. PostgreSQL for the database seems like the best choice.

[10:30 PM]
Got the basic project structure set up:
- FastAPI backend skeleton 
- SQLAlchemy models defined 
- Basic project layout 

[11:15 PM]
Database schema design done:
- Products, Customers, Transactions, Suppliers tables
- Added proper relationships and constraints
- Set up migrations

[12:15 PM]
Created data import utilities:
- CSV parsing functions
- Data validation checks
- Bulk import capabilities

[1:00 PM]
Docker setup in progress:
- Basic Dockerfile created
- PostgreSQL service configured
- Network setup done

[2:30 PM]
Fixed the Docker filesystem issues! The data import is now working correctly. Added auto-import script to Docker startup - this will make testing much easier.

[3:00 PM]
Started implementing core API endpoints. Breaking this down into modules:
- Dashboard overview endpoint (working on it)
- Transaction endpoints (next)
- Inventory management (planned)
- Analytics endpoints (planned)

[4:15 PM]
Made great progress on the API:
- Dashboard overview endpoint complete
- Transaction management working
- Basic fraud detection implemented
Really happy with how the real-time analytics are working!

[5:00 PM]
Just finished the inventory endpoints:
- Low stock alerts working
- Product filtering implemented
- Category management done
The hot reload setup is making development so much faster!

[5:45 PM]
Analytics system coming together nicely:
- Hourly sales tracking
- Customer insights working
- Transaction metrics implemented
Added proper error handling and input validation using Pydantic.

[6:30 PM]
Wrapped up the alert system:
- System status monitoring
- Real-time alerts working
- All endpoints documented

Current Status:
- Backend API fully implemented
- Data import working smoothly
- Development environment optimized
- Ready for testing phase

TODO Tomorrow:
1. Write unit tests
2. Implement caching
3. Add rate limiting
4. Set up monitoring
5. Performance testing

Notes:
- The fraud detection system is working better than expected
- Hot reload configuration is saving tons of time
- Might need to optimize some of the analytics queries
- Should add more comprehensive error logging

[Next Day]

[Customer Management Implementation]
- Created comprehensive customer management UI
- Implemented customer list with server-side pagination
- Added search functionality
- Created detailed customer metrics:
  - Total customers with active rate
  - Retention rate with trends
  - Average order value calculations
  - Purchase frequency tracking
- Built customer details dialog showing:
  - Customer header with risk score
  - Key metrics (total spent, avg order, frequency)
  - Recent transactions list
- Added proper error handling and loading states

[Backend Improvements]
- Updated customer endpoints:
  - GET /customers/ with pagination and search
  - GET /customers/behavior for analytics
  - GET /customers/{customer_id} for details
- Added proper sorting by ID
- Implemented server-side search

Current Focus:
- Main dashboard implementation
- Real-time updates
- Transaction monitoring
- Alert system UI
