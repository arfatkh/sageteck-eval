Work Log - TechMart Analytics Dashboard

[10:00 AM]
Starting with project setup. Going with FastAPI for the backend - really like its async capabilities and the documentation is great. PostgreSQL for the database seems like the best choice for our analytics needs.

[10:30 AM]
Got the basic project structure set up:
- FastAPI backend skeleton ✓
- SQLAlchemy models defined ✓
- Basic project layout ✓
Time spent: 30min

[11:15 AM]
Database schema design done:
- Products, Customers, Transactions, Suppliers tables ✓
- Added proper relationships and constraints ✓
- Set up migrations ✓
Time spent: 45min

[12:15 PM]
Created data import utilities:
- CSV parsing functions ✓
- Data validation checks ✓
- Bulk import capabilities ✓
Time spent: 1hr

[1:00 PM]
Docker setup in progress:
- Basic Dockerfile created ✓
- PostgreSQL service configured ✓
- Network setup done ✓
Time spent: 45min (more work needed)

[2:30 PM]
Fixed the Docker filesystem issues! The data import is now working correctly. Added auto-import script to Docker startup - this will make testing much easier.

[3:00 PM]
Started implementing core API endpoints. Breaking this down into modules:
- Dashboard overview endpoint (working on it)
- Transaction endpoints (next)
- Inventory management (planned)
- Analytics endpoints (planned)

[4:15 PM]
Made great progress on the API:
- Dashboard overview endpoint complete ✓
- Transaction management working ✓
- Basic fraud detection implemented ✓
Really happy with how the real-time analytics are working!

[5:00 PM]
Just finished the inventory endpoints:
- Low stock alerts working ✓
- Product filtering implemented ✓
- Category management done ✓
The hot reload setup is making development so much faster!

[5:45 PM]
Analytics system coming together nicely:
- Hourly sales tracking ✓
- Customer insights working ✓
- Transaction metrics implemented ✓
Added proper error handling and input validation using Pydantic.

[6:30 PM]
Wrapped up the alert system:
- System status monitoring ✓
- Real-time alerts working ✓
- All endpoints documented ✓

Current Status:
✓ Backend API fully implemented
✓ Data import working smoothly
✓ Development environment optimized
✓ Ready for testing phase

TODO Tomorrow:
1. Write unit tests
2. Implement caching
3. Add rate limiting
4. Set up monitoring
5. Performance testing

Notes:
- The fraud detection system is working better than expected
- Hot reload configuration is saving tons of time
- Might need to optimize some of the analytics queries
- Should add more comprehensive error logging

Total time spent today: ~7 hours
Really productive day overall!
